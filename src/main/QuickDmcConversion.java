	 * - Location of image(s), if a folder is passed in then it'll do all images in folder
	 * - Desired location of the output. It'll have a default value dependent on the location.
	 * - What color conversion method you want to use. We'll have presets for this, and it'll default to direct matching.
	 * - Scale up final image size (defaults to 1). This is so the final image isn't tiny.
	 * OUTPUT
	 * - Image(s) that have been converted to closest DMC colors. No pattern mapping, and minimal information about what colors were used.
