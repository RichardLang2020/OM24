	 * INPUT
	 * - Hex color of an incoming color that we're not happy with
	 * - Color matching algorithms that we want to use. If none are chosen, it'll just use all of them (?)
	 * - How many outputs we want total per color algorithm
	 * OUTPUT
	 * - A small UI where a bunch of DMC colors are displayed next to the given color. When the user clicks the closest one, this override is stored into a text document.
	 * - If the hex color HAS ALREADY BEEN OVERRIDDEN, then we will modify the existing override.
	 * - Overrides should be an OPTIONAL ADD-ON to the color matching algorithms and conversions.
