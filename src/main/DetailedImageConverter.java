	 * - Desired location of the output. It'll have a default value dependent on the location.

	 * - Whether or not you want a scale up image output as well
	 * - Ignore overrides or not
	 * - Maybe a low/medium/high setting for fusing colors?
	 *   - Color fusing = "these two dmc colors are close enough, let's just use one instead of using both."
	 * OUTPUT
	 * - Image(s) that have been converted to closest DMC colors. full pattern and information about which threads were used, the OG colors vs new colors, and difference between them
